# Python Basics for Data Science
 Reviewing the essencials of efficient coding in Python for data science pipelines.
In this file, I covered three main concepts of efficient coding for data science pipelines in Python.
These concepts can highly improve the cost efficiency and the quality of codes.

# Numpy Array vs. Python List
Numpy arrays are primarily used for numerical analysis. There are some main advantages of using Numpy array rather than Python Lists for numerical analysis.
* Save coding time: You don't have to iterate through each element of an array to apply mathematical operations (eliminate using for loops), which saves coding time.
* Faster code execution: Numpy arrays use single type of data for each field to avoid type checking. But python lists use different data types for each field that need type checking before execution. Also, numpy arrays use contiguous blocks of memory.
* Use less memory: Python lists are arrays of pointers to python objects that stored somewhere in the memory. So, python lists have lists of pointers that each of these pointers take up 4 bytes plus the stored object in the memory whcih has metadata associated with each object. However, Numpy arrays don't use pointers; also, the type and item size are the same for each column in the array.
